## Introduction:
In this project I have create a generative model for text, character-by-character using LSTM recurrent neural networks in Python with Keras.
Recurrent neural networks can also be used as generative models. LSTM recurrent neural networks can be slow to train and it is highly 
recommend that you train them on GPU hardware. The dependencies between characters and the conditional probabilities of characters in 
sequences so that we can in turn generate wholly new and original sequences of characters. These project is not limited to text, 
you can also experiment with other ASCII data, such as computer source code, marked up documents in LaTeX, HTML or Markdown and more.
